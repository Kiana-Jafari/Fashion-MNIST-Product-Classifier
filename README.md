### Fashion Product Recognition in a Retail Store

In the world of fashion retail, accurately categorizing products based on images is essential for inventory management, recommendation systems, and improving the online shopping experience. The Fashion MNIST dataset is commonly used to benchmark models for this task, containing 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories (e.g., T-shirts, trousers, and sneakers). As a Machine Learning Engineer, we were tasked to build a deep learning model that could classify these images into their respective categories with high accuracy.<br>

During our Analysis, we went through some of the most crucial steps and pointed out some key questions to gain a deeper overview of the business problem. We also went through each phase of the PACE strategy and actively provided detailed explanations.<br>

A general overview:
- Built a machine learning model capable of classifying fashion items with low-resolution images
- Executed comprehensive evaluations of model performance on the validation data, achieved an 82% reduction in overfitting, and enhanced model reliability through regularization and advanced statistical analysis
- Explored and compared various algorithms, optimized performance, and identified the best-performing model
- Applied advanced techniques like data augmentation to improve the model's generalization capability
- Reduced the training time by approximately 94% by fine-tuning effective hyperparameters
- Achieved an impressive classification accuracy of above 90% on both the training and testing sets
- Communicated with stakeholders on technical findings and documented all the processes in each step
- Learned the importance of hyperparameter tuning and how it can significantly impact model performance

The project demonstrated proficiency in machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.
