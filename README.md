### Fashion Product Recognition in a Retail Store

In the world of fashion retail, accurately categorizing products based on images is essential for inventory management, recommendation systems, and improving the online shopping experience. The Fashion MNIST dataset is commonly used to benchmark models for this task, containing 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories (e.g., T-shirts, trousers, and sneakers). As a Machine Learning Engineer, we were tasked to build a deep learning model that could classify these images into their respective categories with high accuracy.<br>

During our Analysis, we went through some of the most crucial steps and pointed out some key questions to gain a deeper overview of the business problem. We also went through each phase of the PACE strategy and actively provided detailed explanations.<br>
The project demonstrated proficiency in machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.

A general overview:
- Asked to develop a model that can accurately classify images of fashion items into categories such as T-shirts, trousers, and sneakers
- Actively collaborated with technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand the business needs and provided a strong solution
- Designed, implemented, and evaluated a machine learning model capable of classifying fashion items with high accuracy
- Loaded the Fashion MNIST dataset and preprocessed the data by normalizing the pixel values and splitting it into training and testing sets
- Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy
- Trained the model using the training dataset and evaluated its performance on the validation set to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting
- Explored different algorithms, optimized performance, and identified the best-performing model.
- Applied techniques like **dropout** and **data augmentation** to improve the model's generalization capabilities
- Optimized the model's performance while comparing different algorithms and techniques to find the best approach
- Reduced the training time by approximately **94.12%** through tuning some of the most effective hyperparameters, such as the number of **batch size** and **kernels**
- Achieved an impressive classification accuracy of above **91%** on both the training and testing sets with the CNN model, which outperformed the other models tested
- Gained a deeper understanding of **convolutional neural networks** and their application in image classification
- Learned the importance of hyperparameter tuning and how it can significantly impact model performance
- Recognized the value of iterative testing and model evaluation, as well as the importance of data preprocessing and augmentation in improving model accuracy
- Developed better problem-solving skills, particularly in selecting the right approach for a given task
- Learned how to effectively communicate technical findings, which has been useful in collaborative projects and professional settings
